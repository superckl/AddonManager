AddonManager
============

Originally, this was created for a private server. But, we found it so useful ,we had decided to release it to the public!

Description:

Addon Manager attempts to revolutionize the way plugins work. Have you ever updated a plugin, then have to restart your server? Why couldn't you just reload that one plugin, without the need to restart? This is exactly what Addon Manager accomplishes through the use of addons.

Addon Manager provides an extensive interface for an addon to use. Using this interface allows the addon to be unloaded from memory and reloaded at anytime. This means you can update them whenever you want! No restarts ever again! Even Addon Manager itself is reload safe!

Practicality:

Since Addon Manager requires an addon to be reload safe, plugins will have to port over to our API. All that requires is changing their registration with Bukkit to use our registration methods (and JavaPlugin to addon). It's that simple! If you are a plugin developer, we beg you to help us get this off the ground. Just leave a post here or send me or FireBlast709 a message saying you would like to help. You'll be the first to try out our API!
